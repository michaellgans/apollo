                <h3>Basics</h3>
                What is your full name? Do you have a nickname (if so, who calls you this)?
                <blockquote>
                    My name is Apollo Iraklidis, Guardian of Light.<br>
                    I do not have a nickname that I enjoy, so I request you call me Apollo.
                </blockquote>
                Where and when were you born?
                <blockquote>
                    I was born in Anroze, the Capital of Dawnforge.<br>
                    I am 28 years of age.
                </blockquote>
                Who are/were your parents? (Their names, birthplaces, occupations, personalities, etc.)
                <blockquote>
                    <h5>Names</h5>
                    Heraclies and Athena Iraklidis
                    <h5>Birthplace</h5>
                    TBD
                    <h5>Occupation</h5>
                    Our father is a the leader of the Rangers of Dawnforge and an advisor to the King.
                    Our mother oversees the scribes of the library and specializes in transcribing documents.
                    <h5>Personalities</h5>
                    Our father is a large bear of a man with a heart almost too big for his chest.  
                    He loves me and my little sister above all else and wishes us to do what makes us truly happy.
                    Our mother is slight and fast, keen and observant.  
                    She cares for us, but she is more focused on what we should act like and become.
                </blockquote>
                Do you have any siblings? If you do, what are/were they like?
                <blockquote>
                    My little sister Artemis is adorable.  She's a rebel and dislikes being told what 
                    to do or why.  I believe my mother wishes her to marry into the roayl family, which 
                    is something that Artemis does not want with every fiber of her being.  Even if it
                    would bring her comfort and riches, she views it as a cage to be locked in.
                </blockquote>
                Where do you live now, and with whom? Describe the place (home and location) and the person/people you live with.
                <blockquote>
                    I live in Anroze with my parents and my sister.  It's a beautiful open place 
                    surrounded by nature.  It's embeded in the mountains and surrounded by forest, yet open 
                    enough to allow for our dragons.
                </blockquote>
                What is your occupation?
                <blockquote>
                    I am a Guardian of Light and a Ranger of Dawnforge.  It is my responsibility to keep 
                    my home safe from those who would cause suffering and perform evil acts.
                </blockquote>
                To which social class do you belong?
                <blockquote>
                    Our family belongs to a higher social class, meaning we must regularly attend events 
                    at the castle, to my sisters delight...
                </blockquote>
                Are you right- or left handed?
                <blockquote>
                    Right handed!
                </blockquote>
                What does your voice sound like?
                <blockquote>
                    Same cadence as Thor and All Might, sounds like Minthara mixed with Aylin from BG3
                </blockquote>
                On what occasions do you lie?
                <blockquote>
                    ABSOLUTELY NEVER
                </blockquote>
                Do you have a motto? If so, what is it?
                <blockquote>
                    "I am the Radiant Guardian of Light and with Ariel's power, may you never again be the cause of suffering!!"
                </blockquote>
                Do you have any annoying habits, quirks, strange mannerisms, or other defining characteristics?
                <blockquote>
                    She's really loud when she gets excited but she's very well behaved otherwise 
                </blockquote>
                What is your hair color and eye color?
                <blockquote>
                    She has white gold hair with streaks of white.  Her eyes are metalic gold.
                </blockquote>
                What kind of distinguishing facial features do you have?
                <blockquote>
                    She has golden freckles all across her cheeks and nose.
                </blockquote>
                Do you have any physical traits that stand out (such as scars, birthmarks, tattoos, etc.)? If you have scars, how did you get them? If you have tattoos, why did you get them and what meaning do they have to you?
                <blockquote>
                    She was just awarded the tattoo of the Rangers of Dawnforge on her left forearm. <br>
                    She has golden lines tattooed throughout her body like tribal markings.
                </blockquote>
                Which words or phrases do you most overuse?
                <blockquote>
                    Vanquished... Excellent...
